    <td>From when I was young, I had always been a flower-loving child. I had often gone to pick the roses and jasmine flowers planted by my dad. I’d string them up and hang them on my neck and wrists, intoxicated by the gorgeous colors and charming fragrance.
I collected some wildflowers by chance a few years ago, and enjoyed fiddling with them. After this, my love for flower arranging has been unstoppable. I am and have always been impressed by the beauty of flowers. I can watch them quietly. I notice the different traits and the beauty of flowers in my own hands. It really is very beautiful. 
Having never taken a flower arranging class before, I had arranged hundreds of works before realizing it. Thanks to my friends for helping me create this website, and for opening a window for me to meet others passionate about flowers.
	I’ve always liked this saying: “若要选择一种方式来浪费时间，那就选择花卉吧” (If you want a way to kill time, choose flowers). In today's society with competitive environments and fast-paced life, many people often forget to stop and watch their own journeys. 
I hope that through flower arranging, people can see another beauty in their life, and enjoy the gifts that nature has given us.
